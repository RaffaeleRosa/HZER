# HZER Horror Zombie Escape Room
(working title...)

Top down horror puzzle/adventure game, inspired by 8/16bit era games.

This is a work in progress / learning prototype to test out functions and features and learn.

## TODO
In no particular order, a list of things to develop:
* Draw tiled map.
* Tiled map collision detection (walls, items, doors, enemies).
* Handle controller input.
* Player movement (that feels natural).
* Player animation (direction, movement, action).
* Enemies
* Enemy AI 
* Menus
* HUD
* Health/Inventory
* Light
* Shaders
* Background music
* Sound effects
* Game logic (objectives)
* Levels

This will get updated and items crossed off with development.
